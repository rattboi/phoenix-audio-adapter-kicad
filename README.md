# Phoenix Version

Modified by Bradon Kanyid (rattboi)

This version uses a JST XH side header instead of RCA jacks. 

This is meant to be paired with https://github.com/rattboi/extron-scart-adapter/

The zipped gerbers in phoenix-adapter/phoenix-adapter-output are ready to go for a site like jlcpcb.com

# Phoenix Audio Adapter
I didn't want to have a bunch of stripped wire connectors on my Extron Crosspoint 12x4 video switch so I decided to make this simple adapter which allows a stacked RCA stereo audio jack (Digikey# CP-1435-ND) to be interfaced to a standard 5pin 3.5mm Phoenix connector.

# Output Differences
The Extron Audio output wiring is different than the input wiring. There are 2 PCBs in this project. Be sure to use the output PCB for your outputs!

## Phoenix Adapter 
This folder contains a PCB which connects L- and R-. You "can" use this PCB for all your needs, provided you cut the R- and L- traces for outputs. If you forget to cut the traces it's probably not a big deal since there is internal resistance (50 ohms or so) in line which each output. Obviously best if they are cut, but not catastrophic by any means.

## Phoenix Adapter Output
This folder contains a PCB which leaves L- and R- floating.
